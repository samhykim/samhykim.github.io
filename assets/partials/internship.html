	Hi Paul and Ted,

	  I have probably left by now, but I wanted to leave you guys a final note at the 
	  end of my internship. Unfortunately we couldn't see each other on my last day, but
	  I know you guys had a blast in London. 

	  I just wanted to say a final thank you to you both for being incredible hosts/mentors
	  to me. Thank you Paul for being such a caring and thoughtful host who really took the
	  time to make sure I was having a fun and valuable internship experience. I am really 
	  glad that you never directly gave me the answer when I was stuck but rather guided me so 
	  that I could figure out the solution on my own. Thank you Ted for looking after me when 
	  Paul was not in the office, carefully reviewing me code (and all of its style errors), and
	  helping me figure out great way to get things done. 

	  This internship has just been an unforgettable experience, and I really couldn't have 
	  done it without you, Paul, choosing me as your intern, and I hope I was able make your 
	  experience as a host rewarding as well. It was amazing to get a taste of Google's culture
	  and I enjoyed every aspect of it. It was surprising to me how a work environment can be
	  so stress-free, as I myself seem to naturally be a stressful person, but Google is full 
	  of hardworking individuals who really know how to collaborate and build each other up
	  while having enormous fun at the same time.

	  This year, I will be taking some exciting courses such as Intro to AI, Data Science, 
	  Machine Learning, Embedded Systems, Probably and Random Processes, and more that will
	  definitely broaden my interests and increase my knowledge in computer science, but nothing
	  trains me to become a better software engineer than do internships. It has been such 
	  an incredible blessing and opportunity to work at Google this summer. Although I haven't
	  decided my future plans yet, I definitely will keep in contact and if I am ever back, 
	  I'll be sure to ping you guys! Please keep in touch and again, thank you for 
	  helping me get to where I am today.

	  P.S: Can you save me a Google cardboard?? :)

	  Sam Kim
